# Azure DevOps

## Introduction

I will create an organization in my Azure portal and create a project **joe-project** to work with. It will have a private visibility with a non TFVC version control, therefore I'll use Git. The work item process provides four options, **Basic, Agile, Scrum and CMMI**, I'll grab the basic one which is lightweight and uses simple models. See full [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process?view=azure-devops&tabs=basic-process).
